    <h2>Brief description of applied technology and history of its development</h2>
    <h3>Brief about ZEV</h3>
    <p>
        A zero-emissions vehicle, or ZEV, is a vehicle that never emits exhaust gas from the onboard source of power.
        Harmful pollutants to the health and the environment include particulates, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone,
        lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. Although not considered emission pollutants by the original California Air
        Resources Board (CARB) or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) definitions, the most recent common use of
        the term also includes volatile organic compounds, several air toxics (most notably 1,3-Butadiene), and global
        pollutants such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
        Zero emissions vehicles are referred to as carbon negative vehicles or that emit less pollutants than other
        vehicles can be referred to as carbon neutral or semi zero-emissions vehicles. Examples of semi zero-emissions
        vehicles include Natural Gas Vehicles since they are not so carbon positive, vehicles in the Euro 6 emission
        standards since they make use of catalytic converter and Exhaust gas recirculation systems and Hybrid electric
        vehicles since they can be driven in pure electric mode and in dual mode thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.
        Examples of zero emission vehicles with different power sources can include muscle-powered vehicles such as
        bicycles, electric bicycles, and gravity racers.
        The ZEV regulation is designed to achieve the state’s long-term emission reduction goals by requiring auto
        manufacturers to offer for sale specific numbers of the very cleanest cars available. These vehicle technologies
        include full battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles. The ZEV regulation is
        part of the broader Advanced Clean Cars package of regulations, a set of tailpipe regulations put in place to
        limit smog-forming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

    </p>
    <h3>ZEVs Dramatically Lower Smog and Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
    <p>
        Battery-electric vehicles (like the Nissan LEAF (picture 1)), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (like the Toyota
        Mirai), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (like the Chevrolet Volt (picture 2)) have ultra-low smog-forming
        and GHG pollutants, even over the life of a vehicle, which includes the vehicle’s fuel production emissions.
        Even compared to 2025 vehicles meeting the strictest smog and GHG fleet standards, ZEVs and plug-in
        hybrid-electric vehicles are significantly lower emitting, and will be essential in order for the light-duty
        vehicle fleet to achieve long term emission reduction goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term zero-emissions or ZEV, as originally coined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), refers only
        to motor vehicle emissions from the onboard source of power. Therefore, CARB's definition is accounting only for
        pollutants emitted at the point of the vehicle operation, and the clean air benefits are usually local because
        depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted
        to the location of the electricity generation plants. In a broader perspective, the electricity used to recharge
        the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear
        power for ZEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. In other words, if ZEVs are recharged from
        electricity generated by fossil fuel plants, they cannot be considered as zero emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the spread of electrical-powered vehicles can help the development of systems for charging the EV
        batteries from excess electricity which cannot be used otherwise. For instance, electricity demand is the lowest
        at nights and the excess generated electricity at this time can be used for recharging the EVs' batteries. It’s
        worth mentioning that renewable sources such as wind turbines or nuclear power plants are less controllable in
        terms of the amount of generated electricity compared to fossil fuel power plants; most of renewable energy
        sources are known as intermittent energy sources. Therefore, development of these resources will lead to excess
        energy which can be better used by development of EVs. Moreover, most of EVs benefit from regenerative brakes
        and other optimization systems which increases the energy efficiency in these vehicles.
    </p>
    <!--    ====-->
    <h2>Types of zero-emission vehicles</h2>
    <p>
        Apart from animal-powered and human-powered vehicles, battery electric vehicles (which include cars, aircraft
        and boats) also do not emit any of the above pollutants, nor any CO2 gases during use. This is a particularly
        important quality in densely populated areas, where the health of residents can be severely affected. However,
        the production of the fuels that power ZEVs, such as the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels, may produce
        more emissions per mile than the emissions produced from a conventional fossil fueled vehicle. A well-to-wheel
        life cycle assessment is necessary to understand the emissions implications associated with operating a ZEV.
    </p>
    <h3>Bicycles</h3>
    <p>
        In the mid-19th Century bicycle ownership became common (during the bike boom) - predating mass car ownership.
        In the 1960s, the Flying Pigeon bicycle became the single most popular mechanized vehicle on the planet. Some
        210 million electric bikes are on the road in China.
    </p>
    <h3>Motor vehicles</h3>
    <p>Segway Personal Transporters are two-wheeled, self-balancing, battery-powered machines that are eleven times more
        energy-efficient than the average American car. Operating on two lithium-ion batteries, the Segway PT produces
        zero emissions during operation, and utilizes a negligible amount of electricity while charging via a standard
        wall outlet. </p>
    <h3>Marine</h3>
    <p>
        Wind-powered land vehicles operating on wind exist (using wind turbines and kites). For boats and other
        watercraft, regular and special sails (as rotor sails, wing sails, turbo sails, skysails) exist that can propel
        them without emissions.
        Lloyd’s Register has partnered with a consortium of companies to develop an ammonia-fuelled ship.
    </p>
    <h3>Air</h3>
    <p>
        An electric aircraft is an aircraft powered by electric motors. Electricity may be supplied by a variety of
        methods including batteries, ground power cables, solar cells, ultracapacitors, fuel cells and power beaming.
        ... Between 2015 and 2016, Solar Impulse 2 completed a circumnavigation of the Earth using solar power.
    </p>
    <h2>How the ZEV regulation works</h2>
    <p>
        The ZEV program assigns each automaker “ZEV credits.” Automakers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a
        set percentage of non-electric sales. Each car sold earns a number of credits based on the type of ZEV and its
        battery range. The credit requirement is 7 percent in 2019, which will require about 3 percent of sales to be
        ZEVs. The credit requirement rises to 22 percent in 2025, which will likely require less than 8 percent of sales
        to be ZEVs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ZEV program requires increasing sales of ZEVs over the next decade. The annual sales requirements in state
        programs are modest at the outset, but increase over time, anticipating that consumer demand will expand as
        consumers become more familiar with a growing range of continually improving ZEV products. The ZEV program
        provides manufacturers substantial flexibility through mechanisms such as credit banking and trading,
        alternative compliance options, cross-state credit pooling, and by allowing manufacturers to develop their
        preferred compliance strategy using Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs),
        Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), or some combination. The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation
        estimates that by 2025, about 5.4 percent of new vehicles sold in Vermont will be required to be ZEVs.
    </p>
    <h2>Vehicle credit formula</h2>
    <p>
        Automakers earn credits by selling zero emission cars and trucks. The credit per vehicle varies with drivetrain
        type and electric range. From 2018 onwards, plug-in hybrids—which only partially drive on electricity—receive
        between 0.4 and 1.3 credits per vehicle sold. Battery electric and fuel cell vehicles receive between 1 and 4
        credits, based on range.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        ZEV as they currently stand are far less polluting than their combustion engine counterparts. As the technology
        becomes more mainstream, it is likely to become even more efficient and sustainable. Economies of scale will
        benefit EV manufacturing by providing better infrastructure, more efficient manufacturing techniques, recycling
        options and reduce the need for the mining of new materials. Electric vehicles are not a panacea but combined
        with greater deployment of renewables and the decarbonization of the electricity grid they offer a pathway to
        greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
